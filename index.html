                <div class="prodinfo" id="teninfo"><b>Introduction-</b>
                    Chlorpyrifos 50% E.C Insecticide is a broad-spectrum insecticide formulated as an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) containing 50% chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide that acts as a contact, stomach, and respiratory poison. By disrupting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the insect nervous system, chlorpyrifos prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter essential for normal nerve function. This disruption leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine, causing overstimulation of nerve cells, paralysis, and eventual death of insects.
                    
                    <b>Active Ingredient and Mode of Action-</b>
                    The active ingredient in Chlorpyrifos 50% E.C Insecticide is chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate insecticide that is chemically similar to the natural insecticide paraoxon. When insects ingest, inhale, or come into contact with chlorpyrifos, it binds to acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine. This binding inhibits the activity of acetylcholinesterase, allowing acetylcholine to accumulate in the insect nervous system. The excess acetylcholine overstimulates nerve cells, leading to muscle tremors, paralysis, and respiratory failure.
                    
                    <b>Application Methods-</b>
                    Chlorpyrifos 50% E.C Insecticide can be applied as a foliar spray, soil drench, or seed treatment.
                    
                    1.Foliar spray: Mix the recommended dosage of Chlorpyrifos 50% E.C Insecticide in water and apply it to the leaves of plants until they are thoroughly wet.
                    
                    2.Soil drench: Mix the recommended dosage of Chlorpyrifos 50% E.C Insecticide in water and apply it to the soil around the base of plants.
                    
                    3.Seed treatment: Mix the recommended dosage of Chlorpyrifos 50% E.C Insecticide with water and coat seeds before planting.
                    
                    4.Soil fumigation: Chlorpyrifos can be used to fumigate soil before planting to control soil-borne pests and diseases.
                    
                    <b>Dosage Rates</b>
                    The recommended dosage rate of Chlorpyrifos 50% E.C Insecticide varies depending on the target pest, crop, soil type, application method, and environmental conditions. Consult the product label for specific dosage instructions.</div>

                                                Triazophos FMC 40EC works by interfering with the nervous system of target pests. The contact action affects pests that come into direct contact with the insecticide, while the stomach action kills pests that ingest it.
                                                
                                                The translaminar action allows the insecticide to penetrate deep into the plant tissues, effectively controlling pests hiding within the plant, such as in the cotton bolls. This is especially important for controlling pests like Spotted Bollworm and Pink Bollworm, which often infest the plant's reproductive parts.
                                                
                                                As an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, Triazophos disrupts the nerve function of the insects, causing paralysis and ultimately their death.

                                                        Mode of Action: LINKER affects the nervous system of an organism by disrupting the gating mechanism of sodium channels involved in the generation of nerve impulses. This leads to hyperexcitation of nerve fibres and convulsions making the insects paralyzed and finally results in death of the target pest.
                                                        <b>Key Features & Benefits-</b>
